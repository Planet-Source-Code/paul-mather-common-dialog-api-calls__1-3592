## Common Dialog API calls


</div>

### Description

Here are the Windows API calls for the ShowOpen, ShowSave, ShowPrinter, ShowColor and ShowFont (Thanks to Jaen Saul aka SlowByte for his post) dialogs. Also included is the beginnings of the ShowFonts dialog but I am haning some trouble getting it to work. These calls are more difficult to use than the CommonDialog control placed on a form, but don't have the version conflicts that Early-Bound and Form-Bound ActiveX controls have. In addition, I have added the ability to center the dialog on the form or center it on the screen.
 
### More Info
 
These calls make use of global variable types to pass information into the dialog box. Please see the examples in Form1.

Note that calling the wrong flags will cause your app to crash VB so save early and save often!!!
